                    <li><a href="https://github.com/oashtari/EpiPedia">A pseudo Wikipedia page called "EpiPedia". Our focus here was to utitlize our newly acquired Bootstrap knowledge.</a></li>

            <h3>Here's where I talk about me...I <strong>HATE</strong> talking about <em>me</em>.</h3>
            <p>
                I grew up in Los Angeles and went to school there, but I'll skip most of that and focus on my professional path, as it especially relates to my journey to Epicodus. I spent the first ten years of my career in the entertainment business at a company called <a href="http://www.caa.com/">CAA</a>. Definitely worth a visit to their page, it is <em>quite</em> a simple one. Feeling unfulfilled, and intrigued by the technology business, I was fortunate to join a company called <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, that was surely a fun ride, but also <strong>exhausting</strong>. Still longing for more creative and impactful input, a hunger to learn coding/programming was growing stronger. Then an exciting 18 months that included:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Getting a dog, you know him from above.</li>
                    <li>Getting engaged, you know her from class.</li>
                    <li>Moving to Portland.</li>
                    <li>Getting a cat, please meet Ory, our <span style="color:grey">grey</span> tabby kitty: <br/><img src="img/IMG_0661.JPG" alt="A picture of Ory, a grey tabby cat, in a sink" class="img-circle" height="125px" width="125px" id="rotate90"/></li>
                    <li>Getting hitched...married, that is.</li>
                    <li>Getting another cat as Ory was lonely, please meet Baker: <br /><img src="img/IMG_0701.JPG" alt="A picture of Baker, our new tuxedo cat, and Ory" class="img-circle" width="125px" height="125px" id="rotate90" /></li>
                    <li>A few other things too...</li>
                </ol><br />
            <p>And <span style="color:#4747d1"><strong>FINALLY</strong></span> a chance to commit some time to learning programming, lead me to this evening course at Epicodus.</p><br />
